# Stephan-s-Awesome-Weather-App

In this program, my goal was to make a weather application that can give the user weather of any city that they search. It also saves recent searches that can be accessed once the user searches for a city, the list can be clicked on with the desired city showing up. Unfortunatley, the cities cannot be accessed when you reload the page on click, however the cities and recent search history still do not show up. Below is a link to the application and a screenshot of the application.
